@top Introduction

ZIO is meant to be ``the ultimate I/O framework.  It is being developed
on the open hardware repository at @url{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/zio}.

The framework is meant to offer a flexible interface for the
development of input and output drivers for very-high-bandwidth
devices with high-definition time stamps.

The version at time of this writing is known to compile and run with
kernels 2.6.34 onwards.

@chapter General Concepts

While the design is pretty stable and we don't plan to introduce any
serious change in the code that affects our users, there are some
research ideas that we are evaluating and experimenting with.  Thus,
we want to define from the start both the words that we are using
within the framework and the ideas that will be introduced at a later
time.

@cindex block
The ZIO framework is designed to move @i{data blocks}, or just
@i{block} for short (not in italic from now on). A block is a sequence
of zero or more data samples with associated meta-information. Blocks
containing a single data sample are not expected to be common, as our
use case is concerned with devices that input or output several
thousand samples in a single shot, with a hardware-defined data rate
and a single time-stamp marking the beginning of the event.  Blocks
containing zero data items are not forbidden, because they can be used
to pass meta-information without associated data (e.g., TDC and DTC
devices, described later.

@cindex control
A block can flow in either the input or output direction.  The
meta-information about a block is stored in a @i{control structure} or
just @i{control} for short (again, not in italic in this document).

The ZIO code base is designed around three main items:

@table @r
@cindex device
@item Device
	A ZIO device describes one specific I/O peripheral. See
	@ref{The Device}.

@cindex trigger
@item Trigger
	The trigger is code concerned with firing I/O, in response to
        some event. ZIO supports both software triggers and hardware
        triggers; in the latter case the software module is used to
        configure to the device and retrieve status information.
        See @ref{The Trigger}.

@cindex buffer
@item Buffer 
	A buffer stores blocks, either input blocks
        generated by a trigger or output blocks generated by some
        injecting code One end of the buffer is always connected to a
	trigger, and the other end is usually connected to a char
	device (but ZIO buffers are not constrained to).
        See @ref{The Buffer}.
@end table

@cindex driver
The ZIO driver manages a @i{device}, which in turn may be either a
chip or a PCB (or something else). The driver is the @i{probe unit},
i.e. a batch of I/O peripherals that are plugged and unplugged as a
whole, usually based on some bus, like PCI, USB or SPI.

@cindex device
Devices include I/O channels of one or more type. A PCI board for
example may have both analogue input and digital output, while
an SPI chip will usually offer only one channel type.  A ZIO
device, thus, is described as a collection of @i{channel-sets},
or @i{csets} for short -- again, in roman font throughout this
document.

@cindex cset
A cset is a group of channels usually associated with a wire connected
to some backplane of the computer.  All channels within a cset must be
alike: same sample size and same configuration options (i.e.,
configuration values may vary across channels in the same cset, but
all of them must feature the same set, like gain and offset).

@cindex channel
The channel is the basic I/O entity, usually associated with a single
socket on some backplane.

The next figure depicts ZIO's layered structure.
@sp 1
@center @image{img/zio-layers, 8cm}
@sp 1

@cindex cset
The cset is the most important object for ZIO devices. Each cset is
associated with a trigger, and I/O events affects all channels in the
cset -- although you can disable individual channels as needed.

Each cset has a @i{current_trigger} attribute, which defines a trigger
type; ZIO creates an instance of the trigger type for each cset using
it.  Each cset has a @i{current_buffer} attribute as well. ZIO creates
a buffer instance for each channel in the cset.  Thus, each channel
owns a buffer instance, but of the same type across the cset.

The figure below shows a cset, the trigger and buffer types it refers
to an the instances it is using. A cset has one trigger instance
overall and one buffer instance for each channel.

@node Supported Devices
@section Supported Devices

@cindex devices, supported
This is a quick list of devices or device types that are supported in
the current version of ZIO.  This is a cursory overlook, for some of
them more information is provided in specific sections of
@ref{Available Modules}.

@table @r

@cindex zio-zero
@cindex zero
@item zero device

	The zero device is a software-driven input and output device,
        it is used for demonstration and stress-testing.

@c FIXME: zero-t

@cindex gpio
@item gpio device

	The gpio device acts on an array of input and output GPIO pins.
        Again, we think it's a useful example.

@cindex uart
@cindex line discipline
@item uart device

	ZIO includes a line discipline device, that can be connected to
        a serial port or a @i{pty}.

@cindex SPI
@item SPI devices

	Some ADC devices connected to the SPI bus are supported, it should
        be easy to add more.

@cindex RAM-based buffer
@cindex buffers using system RAM
@item RAM-based buffers

	The distributions includes generic buffers based on system RAM.
	See @ref{Available Buffers}.

@cindex triggers, software driven
@item Various software-driven triggers

	This version includes a few software-driven trigger: kernel timer,
        external interrupt (GPIO or otherwise) and a transparent trigger
        to be used when the device must run continuously with it's own
        I/O data rate. See @ref{Available Triggers}.

@end table

@c ==========================================================================
@node Future Developments
@section Future Developments

@cindex future developments
@cindex development ideas
The following list outlines future developments which are being studied
and/or already tested.

@itemize @bullet
 
@cindex bus type for ZIO
@item Defining a ZIO bus type

	Using a bus type, we'll be able to instantiate several card/chips
        of the same kind, within a single host. Initially we decided to
        avoid it for simplicity.

@cindex input subsystem and ZIO
@item Writing @code{input_device} for the kernel

	A buffer type may injiect input events to the Linux input
        subsystem, and we feel it's an easy and interesting feature to offer.

@cindex Ethernet support inside ZIO
@item Writing an Ethernet ZIO buffer

	This buffer will be able to send input blocks as network frames
        and receive output blocks in network frames. The buffer will
        register an @i{eth} device, with an own MAC address, so frames
        may be exchanged with remote hosts, either as UDP packets
        or raw frames.

@cindex PF_ZIO, network protocol family
@cindex AF_ZIO, network address family
@item Writing a new PF_ZIO network type.

	The protocol family @code{PF_ZIO} will be used both as
        @i{ethertype} for raw frames and as a new address family 
        (@code{AF_ZIO}) where
        each channel has a network address, with the @i{control} acting
        as link-level protocol header. This will allow applications to
        open only a single socket (or a few of them) instead of one
        or two char devices for each channel being used.

@cindex interface, to abstract file operations
@item Defining the ``zio_interface'' data structure.

	The @i{interface} will abstract char device support out of
        the ZIO core, so users will be able to use different interfaces;
        the PF_ZIO protocol will therefore be able to use
        hardware-specific buffers when the device requires them.

@c FIXME -- other ideas in the queue

@cindex data model
This chapter defines in detail the data model of ZIO. The
unconventional data model is the main idea behind the ZIO project.

@end menu

@c ==========================================================================
@node The Block
@section The Block

@cindex block
@cindex samples
Our typical use case handles several samples at the same time. We need
to manage thousands or even millions of samples at the same time,
because I/O is performed at hardware level (within the FPGA) and the
driver only passes data around.

For this reason ZIO defines a block structure.  All data transfers
within ZIO happen in the context of a block, which is the atomic data
item.

@tindex zio-buffer.h
The block structure is defined in @code{zio-buffer.h} in the following
way:

@tindex zio_block
@example
   struct zio_block {
           unsigned long           ctrl_flags;
           void                    *data;
           size_t                  datalen;
           size_t                  uoff;
   }; 
@end example

A block  may be depicted as shown in the next figure:

@sp 1
@center @image{img/zio-block, 5cm}
@sp 1

The meaning of the fields is:

@table @code
@item ctrl_flags

	The field includes a pointer to a control structure and one flag
        bit, described below. 

@item data

	The pointer to actual data associated with this block.

@item datalen

	The length of the memory area pointed-to by @i{data} above. May
        be zero for TDC or DTC devices.

@item uoff

	@i{User offset}. This field is used when data is being consumed
        or produced in the context of a stream-like interface, like a
        chat device is.

@end table

We chose to coalesce the pointer to control and the @code{cdone} bit
in a single filed in order to avoid wasting bytes and/or break alignment
of the structure. The same trick is used in the @i{rbtree} implementation
within the Linux kernel, and it is pretty efficient.

@tindex zio-buffer.h
@code{zio-buffer.h} defines the following macros to access parts
of the @code{ctrl_flags} field:

@findex zio_get_ctrl
@findex zio_set_ctrl
@findex zio_is_cdone
@findex zio_set_cdone
@smallexample
#define zio_get_ctrl(block) ((struct zio_control *)((block)->ctrl_flags & ~1))
#define zio_set_ctrl(block, ctrl) ((block)->ctrl_flags = (unsigned long)(ctrl))
#define zio_is_cdone(block)  ((block)->ctrl_flags & 1)
#define zio_set_cdone(block)  ((block)->ctrl_flags |= 1)
@end smallexample

As shown @code{ctrl} is a pointer and @code{cdone} is a bit. The bit
is used to keep track of whether a stream-like interface already
managed the control structure or not. A typical user is the @i{read}
file operation.  See @ref{Accessing ZIO from User Space}.

@c ==========================================================================
@node The ZIO Pipeline
@section The ZIO Pipeline

@cindex pipeline of zio data transfers
During input and output operations, ZIO blocks travel across a
pipeline of objects.

@cindex system calls
User space makes system calls, which are implemented by the
@code{file_operations} in the active buffer. Generic functions are
implemented in @code{zio-cdev.c} and exported as
@code{zio_generic_fops} (currently all buffers included in the
distribution are using these operations).  This will slightly change
when we the @i{interface} concept will be introduced, but the change
will not affect buffers (only, they won't have a @code{f_op} pointer
any more). See @ref{Future Developments} about the @i{interface} idea.

@findex store_block
@findex retr_block
The file operations code calls @code{store_block} and
@code{retr_block} in the proper buffer instance, the buffer in turn
communicates with the trigger, and the trigger refers to the device
for the raw data transfer.

@cindex block allocation
@cindex allocation of blocks
@cindex input pipeline
The next figure shows the input pipeline, showing where a block is
allocated and then freed. Time in the figure is flowing downwards.

@sp 1
@center @image{img/zio-input, 14cm}
@sp 1

@cindex output pipeline
The pipeline for output is similar, but the block is allocated by
the implementation of the @i{write} system call. Note in particular
how the buffer works in exactly the same ways as in the input case:
it servers @code{store_block} and @code{retr_block} requests.

@sp 1
@center @image{img/zio-output, 14cm}
@sp 1


@c ==========================================================================
@node The Control Structure
@section The Control Structure

@cindex control structure
@cindex size of control structure
The @i{control} is the container of meta-information used to describe
a block of data. Its size is fixed to 512 bytes and won't change in
future ZIO releases (in some case we may concatenate several control
structures, but this will be self-described).

@cindex monitoring application
The structure is fixed in order to simplify communication with user
space, and allow generic applications to perform monitoring or other
operations without the need to know device internals.  A similar
approach is used by the @i{event} devices in the input subsystem.

The control is depicted in the next figure:

@sp 1
@center @image{img/zio-control, 5cm}
@sp 1

@cindex meta-information
The control is designed to offer the full meta-information needed to
describe the block. In includes names and parameters for both the
device and the current trigger. Applications can thus pass around a
block without knowing what it is; thus, knowledge about device and
trigger details can be concentrated in a single place, without the
need to spread information to all actors in the input/output pipeline.

@cindex offline data management
By using a control structure (i.e., zio blocks in their entirety)
ZIO users can perform
both offline data generation and offline data analysis. A program
may prepare an output waveform in advance and ask generic tools to
deliver it to the device; similarly, acquisition may be performed by
generic tools that concentrate data from a set if I/O computers to a
data center where programs that know the hardware can digest all data
blocks.

@cindex control_structure
@tindex zio-user.h
The control structure is defined in @code{zio-user.h} because it
must be accessed by both kernel and user space. This is the
detail of it:

@tindex zio_control
@smallexample
struct zio_control {
        /* byte 0 */
        uint8_t major_version;
        uint8_t minor_version;
        uint8_t more_ctrl;      /* number of further ctrl, for interleaved */
        uint8_t alarms;         /* set by channel, persistent, write 1 to clr */

        /* byte 4*/
        uint32_t seq_num;       /* block sequence number */
        uint32_t flags;         /* endianness etc, see below */
        uint32_t nsamples;      /* number of samples in this data block */

        /* byte 16 */
        uint16_t ssize;         /* sample-size for each of them, in bytes */
        uint16_t sbits;         /* sample-bits: number of valid bits */
        uint16_t cset_i;        /* index of channel-set within device */
        uint16_t chan_i;        /* index of channel within cset */

        /* byte 24 */
        uint8_t hostid[8];      /* Macaddress or whatever unique */

        /* byte 32 */
        struct zio_timestamp tstamp;

        /* byte 56 */
        uint32_t mem_offset;    /* position in mmap buffer of this block */
        uint32_t reserved;      /* possibly another offset, or space for 64b */

        /* byte 64 */
        /* The control block includes what device the data belongs to */
        char devname[ZIO_OBJ_NAME_LEN];

        /* byte 76 */
        /* Each data block is associated with a trigger and its features */
        char triggername[ZIO_OBJ_NAME_LEN];

        /* byte 88 */
        struct zio_ctrl_attr attr_channel;
        struct zio_ctrl_attr attr_trigger;

        /* byte 488 */
        uint8_t __fill_end[ZIO_CONTROL_SIZE - 488];
};
@end smallexample

This is the meaning of all the fields. Some of them are not currently
being filled by the code and the description here doesn't always
reflect the code status. We plan to detail the status of each of them
soon -- while auditing and completing support for it.

@table @code

@cindex version numbers in ZIO
@item major_version
@itemx minor_version

	The version is currently 0.4, as defined by @code{ZIO_MAJOR_VERSION}
        and @code{ZIO_MINOR_VERSION} (in @code{zio.h}). The version is used
        to ensure all actors agree on the meaning of the fields. Since version
        1, we ansure that all minor version changes will be compatible (i.e.,
        new fields are there but they may be ignored) and incompatible
        changes will force an upgrade of the major number -- for example,
        if the layout of attributes changes for some reason.

@cindex interleaved acquisition
@item more_ctrl

	This field, not used in the current code, can state that this
        data block is described by more than one control structure. It
        represents the number of additional control structures (all 512 byte
        long) that are used in this block. The field is always 0 with
        current code but we won't upgrade the version number when using it;
        so applications should be ready for it to be greater than 0 and
        act accordingly.

@item alarms

	A mask of active alarm. They should be cleared by writing 1 to
        them.  They are not currently in use, and the mechanism to clear them
        in @i{sysfs} is designed but not implemented.
@c FIXME alarm

@cindex sequence numbers in control structures
@item seq_num

	Block sequence number. It starts at 1 and can be checked to know
        about lost blocks for buffer overflows. The value 0 is
        reserved as a signal that the sequence number is not used by the
        entity that generated the block (e.g., user space).

@item flags

	The flags specify features of the data block. See below.

@cindex size of data samples
@cindex sample size
@item nsamples
@itemx ssize
@itemx sbits

	Number of samples, sample size in bytes, and sample bits.  The
        fields are used to describe the data itself. Sample size
        and sample bits are both needed because we may have something like
        5-bit samples aligned in 32-bit words.

@cindex index of cset and channel
@item cset_i
@itemx chan_i

	The index of the cset and the channel within the device

@cindex host identifier
@item hostid

	Identification of the host where this device/cset/channel tuple
        is hosted. This is not currently set nor read by ZIO, but will be
        soon added to easily support multi-host environments with centralized
        data generation or consumtions, ensuring proper routing. The
        meaning of the field is application-specific; it may be a MAC
        address or whatever. We plan to add a default @i{hostid} value
        for input channels, set as a module parameter.

@cindex timestamp
@item struct zio_timestamp tstamp

	The timestamp associated with this input or output event. For
        input, the trigger must fill it, and it may be software-generated or
        hardware-generated.  For output, some triggers use it and some
        don't (for example, and externa-irq trigger won't use pre-set
        timestamps).  The internals of this stucture are defined later.

@cindex mmap support
@item mem_offset

	If the buffer supports @i{mmap}, this is the memory offset of
        the data in the buffer's storage area. Please note that the
        @i{data} pointer in the block structure is valid nonetheless.

@cindex name of device and trigger
@item devname
@itemx triggername

	Name of the device this control refers to and of the trigger
        currently active. For input, the names are filled by ZIO, for
        output they may be used by applications to route packets or
        switch triggers, but ZIO ignores them when the block is fed to
        output character devices.

@item attr_channel
@itemx attr_trigger

	Attributes for the channel and the trigger. Each structure
        is 200 bytes long and includes both standard and extended attributes.
        The attributes are describe in @ref{The Attributes}.

@item __fill_end

	This filler ensures that the size of the control structure is
        512 bytes. ZIO includes a compile-time check for the size of
        the control structure, to ensure this field has the right length
        even if someone changes the structure (and version number).

@end table

We currently define the following flags, in @code{zio-user.h}:

@table @code

@cindex endianness of data
@item ZIO_CONTROL_LITTLE_ENDIAN
@itemx ZIO_CONTROL_BIG_ENDIAN

	These are used to identify how data is written in this block.
	For input channels, data is produced in native endianness;
        for output channels the applications must convert everything
        to native endianness (i.e., ZIO doesn't fix data in kernel space).
        Both these flags are endian-agnostic, so a endian-aware application
        may read the @code{flags} field as a 32-bit integer, and apply
        endian conversion to all other fields if needed.

@cindex alignment of data samples
@item ZIO_CONTROL_MSB_ALIGN
@itemx ZIO_CONTROL_LSB_ALIGN

	The flags specify where the active sample bits (@code{sbits})
        are placed within the bytes of a sample (@code{ssize}). Both
        flags are not 0; if neither is set the alignment is unspecified.

@end table

@c ==========================================================================
@node The Time Stamp
@section The Time Stamp

@cindex timestamp
Time stamps in ZIO are represented by @code{struct zio_timestamp},
defined in @code{zio-user.h} because it is shared with user space.
It is is made of 3 64-bit fields:

@tindex zio_timestamp
@example
struct zio_timestamp {
        uint64_t secs;
        uint64_t ticks;
        uint64_t bins;
};
@end example

The meaning of the three fields is channel-specific, in order to cater
for any hardware requirements without imposing conversions in kernel
space.  We have, however, some suggestions for use of the fields in
a consistent way:

@table @code
@cindex seconds in timestamps
@item secs

	The field should be used to host an UTC or TAI value, i.e.
        the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970. The field is 64-bits
        wide to preserve alignment and to allow of a different choice
        of the epoch, if needed.  When ZIO uses software timestamping
        for input channels, the field hosts the @code{tv_sec} value
        of a @code{struct timespec}.

@cindex nanoseconds in timestamps
@item ticks

	The field should be used to host a nanosecond count, if this
        choice makes sense for the hardware at hand. If you need to
        use a scalar nanosecond value, without a separate @i{seconds}
        component, this is where to host the value.

@cindex hardware-specific timestamps
@item bins

	This field should be used for any high-precision number as used
        in the hardware. It may also be the only non-zero field, for
        example if the hardware timestamp is taken from a custom counter
        without a second or nanosecond component, if it fits in 64 bits.

@end table

@cindex White Rabbit
For example, @i{White Rabbit} devices use hardware timestamps made up
of three 32-bit values: seconds, nanoseconds with a granularity of 8ns
or 16ns and phase offsets as picoseconds within the 8ns or 16ns
interval.  In this case, ZIO timestamps will store the seconds in
@code{secs}, the nanoseconds in @code{ticks} (with 0 in the 3 or 4
LSB) and the phase in the @code{bins} field.

@cindex data block
The data pointed-to by a control structure is just opaque data for
ZIO.  For output, it's the device that makes sense of it (or just
passes it hardware without knowing what it is); for input, it's the
final destination of the data that will use it according to the
device/cset/channel it originated from, and the information about
sample size, bits and alignment found in the control structure.

@section The Generic Object Head

@cindex object head in ZIO
All data structures that refer to a ZIO object include a
@code{zio_obj_head} structure.  The head factorizes a few fields that
are used across ZIO for object management (including the structure
that is used in building the @i{sysfs} tree).
@c FIXME: document object head to more detail

@c ==========================================================================
@node The Device
@section The Device

@cindex device
A @i{device} is the description of a complete I/O peripheral device (or
board). A device is made up of channel-sets and may represent a PCI
board or an SPI integrated circuit or whatever it makes sense to
manage from a single device driver. The device is primarily a container
of csets, but it also host attributes that affect all csets at the same
time (they may be defined or not, according to features of the specific
physical device).

The most important fields of @code{struct zio_device} for the developer
are:

@tindex zio_device
@table @code

@cindex cset, array of
@item struct zio_cset *cset
@itemx unsigned int n_cset

	The array of channel sets belonging to this device.

@cindex trigger, preferred
@cindex buffer, preferred
@cindex preferred buffer and trigger
@item char *preferred_buffer
@item char *preferred_trigger

	The device may specify a device-wide default trigger type
	and/or buffer type. This allow a device with an hardware-internal
        trigger to used that as soon as it is initialized, instead
        of requiring the user to select it.  If the fields are NULL
        or the preferred type is not available in the running instance
        of ZIO, the system-wide defaults for buffer and trigger type will
        be used.        

@cindex sysfs operations
@tindex zio_sysfs_operations
@item const struct zio_sysfs_operations	*s_op

	The structure includes the @code{info_get} and @code{conf_set}
        methods that act on ZIO attributes. See @ref{The Attributes}.

@cindex device operations
@item const struct zio_device_operations *d_op

	The device operations are used to request input or output
        from/to a specific cset in the device. @b{Note:} we are
        going to remove them and have a @code{raw_io} function for
        each cset instead.

@end table

We won't describe further details of @code{struct zio_device} at this point,
because some details may still change in the near future.
@c FIXME: describe whole zio_device

@cindex cset
As said, the cset is a homogeneous set of I/O channels belonging to a
single device. All channels in the set have the same physical
characteristics.  This object is the most important in the ZIO device
hierarchy because all data transfers are cset-wide. Each cset
includes a pointer to the current trigger and buffer types.

@tindex zio_cset
The most important fields of @code{Struct zio_cset} to be filled
or used by the developer are:

@table @code

@cindex sample size
@item  unsigned ssize

	The sample size, in bytes, for each channel in the cset.
        Different channels may feature a different number of
        significant bits, but they are expected to share the sample
        size in the data blocks.

@item unsigned long flags

	Currently only the type: @code{ZCSET_TYPE_DIGITAL} or
	@code{ZCSET_TYPE_ANALOG}. The flag has only informative value.
@c FIXME: CSET_TYPE_TIME

@cindex channel template
@item struct zio_channel *chan_template

	This points to a channel structure that is used by ZIO as
        a template. All channels in the cset are homogeneous, so ZIO
        will allocate the array of channels when the device is registered,
        by replicating this template and updating the @i{index} value for
        each of them.

@item unsigned int n_chan

	The number of channels in this cset.

@cindex array of channels
@item struct zio_channel *chan

	The array of channels, allocated by ZIO at registration time.
@c FIXME: check what happens with chan_template and chan at cset creation

@cindex private pointers in the cset
@item void *priv_d

	A private pointer for the device, in case it needs it.

@cindex cset, init and exit functions
@cindex init function for the cset
@cindex exit function for the cset
@item int (*init)(struct zio_cset *cset)
@itemx void (*exit)(struct zio_cset *cset)

	The function pointers, if not NULL, are called by ZIO at
        cset registration and removal time, after allocating (before
        removing) the channel array. They may useful to resp. setup
        and release the @code{priv_d} field.

@end table

@cindex channel
@cindex Etherbone
The channel is the lowest-level object in the ZIO hierarchy.  It
represents the individual connector of the device, most likely a
socket in some backplane of some computer (local or remote, in case
@i{Etherbone} is being used.  A channel may also be a software
simulation of a data source/sink of some time.

@tindex zio_channel
The most important fields of @code{struct zio_channel} for the user
are:

@table @code

@cindex private pointers in the channel
@item void *priv_d

	A private pointer for the device (may be allocated by the
        @code{init} function of the cset and released by the corresponding
        @code{exit} function).

@item void *priv_t

	Private data for the trigger, that may be used by the trigger
        during operation.
@c FIXME: who is freeing channel->priv_t?

@end table

@c ==========================================================================
@node The Trigger
@section The Trigger

@cindex trigger
Every data exchange, either input or output, is executed in response
to an event of some kind. ZIO offers a @i{trigger} abstraction
to describe all such events and configure their activation.

Each cset is using a trigger type, and uses an instance of that type.
Different csets can use different trigger types, because the
@code{current_trigger} is an attribute of each cset.  When the trigger
fires, it acts on all the non-disabled channels of the cset.

@cindex input and triggers
@cindex output and triggers
@cindex trigger in input and output flows
For input data flows, the trigger receives blocks from the device and
stores them in the buffer. For output data flows the trigger retrieves
blocks from the buffer and sends them to the device.

@c FIXME: where does the control block come from?

@cindex trigger type, defining
When defining a new trigger type, the most important fields of
@code{struct zio_trigger_type} for the programmer are the following
ones: 
@c FIXME: full definition of trigger_type

@tindex zio_sysfs_operations
@table @code
@item const struct zio_sysfs_operations	*s_op

	These are the operations used to read and write attributes.
        It is the same structure used in the device.

@item const struct zio_trigger_operations *t_op

	The trigger operations, expanded below, are the ones that
        implement the behavior of a trigger type.
@end table

The trigger operations are defined by the following structure:

@tindex zio_trigger_operations
@smallexample
struct zio_trigger_operations {
	int			(*push_block)(struct zio_ti *ti,
					      struct zio_channel *chan,
					      struct zio_block *block);
	void			(*pull_block)(struct zio_ti *ti,
					      struct zio_channel *chan);

	void			(*data_done)(struct zio_cset *cset);

	int			(*config)(struct zio_ti *ti,
					  struct zio_control *ctrl);

	struct zio_ti *		(*create)(struct zio_trigger_type *trig,
					  struct zio_cset *cset,
					  struct zio_control *ctrl,
					  fmode_t flags);
	void			(*destroy)(struct zio_ti *ti);
	void			(*change_status)(struct zio_ti *ti,
						 unsigned int status);
	void			(*abort)(struct zio_cset *cset);
};
@end smallexample

The detailed meaning of the operations is as follows:

@table @code

@cindex create, for triggers
@cindex destroy, for triggers
@item create
@itemx destroy

	The operations are called when this trigger type is associated to
        (resp. de-associated from) a new cset. @code{create} returns
        a trigger instance structure, which is usually part of a larger
        structure that the instance itself will recover with the macro
        @code{container_of}. Please look at existing triggers for details

@cindex push_block
@item push_block

	When a buffer has a complete block of data, it can send it to
        the trigger using @code{push_block}. The trigger can either accept it
        (returns 0) or not (returns @code{-EBUSY}). This because an
        output trigger has only one pending data transfer. When the block is
        consumed, the trigger will call @code{bi->retr_block} to get the next
        one.  Buffering is in the buffer, not in the trigger.
@c FIXME: check push_block for double buffering

@cindex pull_block
@item pull_block

	For input channels, a buffer may call @code{pull_block}. The trigger
        may thus fire input directly and later have a block.  Most
        triggers won't support the @code{pull_block} way of doing input,
        they will just call @code{bi->store_block} when
        a new block is available. In these cases the @code{pull_block}
        method can be left @code{NULL}.

@cindex data_done
@item data_done

	This method is called by the device. I/O in the device is
        almost always asynchronous, so when asked to transfer a cset,
        the device will prepare to do it, and will call @code{data_done}
        later in the current trigger instance. For output csets,
        @code{data_done} frees the blocks and prepares new blocks
        for the next trigger event; for input, @code{data_done} pushes
        material to the buffers.

@cindex config for triggers
@item config

	The method is not currently used. The idea is that when
        a channel is configured by sending it a complete new control
        structure, this callback allows the trigger to reconfigure itself.
@c FIXME: use the config trigger method

@item change_status
@itemx abort

	To be documented.
@c FIXME: document change_status and abort for triggers

@end table

@c ==========================================================================
@node The Buffer
@section The Buffer

@cindex buffer
The buffer interface in ZIO allows to select between different
allocation techniques and memory access. By splitting the buffer
to a separate ZIO object, the framework allows drivers with special
allocation needs to define their own hardware-specific buffer.

@cindex csets and buffers
Each cset is using a buffer type, for which an instance exists for
each channel in the cset. Data transfers only happen if a channel
is enabled, so different buffers instances in the cset may at
times host a different number of blocks, but this is not the usual case.

The most important fields of @code{struct zio_buffer_type}, from
the point of view of the developer of anew buffer, are the various
operations structures:

@c FIXME: full definition of buffer_type

@tindex zio_buffer_type
@table @code

@item const struct zio_buffer_operations *b_op

	The buffer operations, detailed later, are the function
        that define the actual behavior of a buffer. 

@cindex file operations
@item const struct file_operations *f_op

	File operations are used to provide user-space access to
        the buffer. ZIO exports a @code{zio_generic_fops} structure
        that will work for most users. This pointer will be removed when
        the @i{interface} idea is implemented.

@cindex virtual memory operations
@cindex mmap support
@item const struct vm_operations_struct	*v_op

	Buffer types supporting @i{mmap} must implement the
        virtual memory operations. They allow to keep track of active
        uses of the buffer instance and handle page faults for
        program accessing the buffer.  The operations are associated
        to each @code{vma} mapped to the char device associated to
        a buffer instance of this type. Use is exactly like what
        you do in normal char drivers, with the only difference the
        the @code{open} method is called when @i{mmap} happens.
        Please refer to the @code{zio-buf-vmalloc} implementation for
        details.
@c FIXME: vmalloc reference to in-manual vmalloc desc

@end table

The buffer operations are defined as follows:

@tindex zio_buffer_operations
@smallexample
struct zio_buffer_operations {
	struct zio_block *	(*alloc_block)(struct zio_bi *bi,
					       struct zio_control *ctrl,
					       size_t datalen, gfp_t gfp);
	void			(*free_block)(struct zio_bi *bi,
					      struct zio_block *block);

	int			(*store_block)(struct zio_bi *bi,
					       struct zio_block *block);
	struct zio_block *	(*retr_block) (struct zio_bi *bi);

	struct zio_bi *		(*create)(struct zio_buffer_type *zbuf,
					  struct zio_channel *chan);
	void			(*destroy)(struct zio_bi *bi);
};
@end smallexample

This is the specific role of each method in the structure:

@table @code

@cindex create, for buffers
@cindex destroy, for buffers
@item create
@itemx destroy

	When ZIO associates a buffer with a new channel, it calls the
        @code{create} operation. The returned @code{zio_bi} structure
        will usually be part of a bigger structure used internally
        by the buffer implementation, using the @code{container_of}
        macro to access it from the @code{zio_bi} pointer.

@cindex alloc_block
@cindex free_block
@item alloc_block
@itemx free_block

	The buffer is concerned with memory management, so whenever
        the trigger or the @i{write} system call need a new block,
        they ask it to the buffer type. Similarly, the buffer type
        is asked to release blocks.

@cindex store_block
@cindex retr_block
@item store_block
@itemx retr_block

	The functions simply add a block to an existing buffer instance
        or ask to retrieve a block out of it.  In addition to managing
        storage according to its own will, the buffer is requested to
        make two special actions. When @code{store_block} inserts
        the first block in an empty output buffer, the method must
        call the @code{push_block} method of the associated trigger.
        When @code{retr_block} asks for a block from an empty input buffer,
        the method must call @code{pull_block} in the associated trigger,
        if not NULL. Please refer to existing implementations
        for details.
